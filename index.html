  <H1>The World is Yours !<H1>

<h2><i>Dear Young World</i>,</h2>
  <br>
<h4>
The world is yours, don't waste time trying to impress anybody, don't follow the crowd, follow your heart. Just because everyone else is doing something doesn't mean you have to do it, don't be a follower, be a leader. In this world we live in, we must understand these two things: the only thing we can't get back is time and the most important thing in life is faith in God and Family.<h4>

<h1>Leave The Streets Alone</h1>

<h4>Hanging with the wrong crowd can mess up your life forever. They say you are who you hang with, for example if you hang with 5 losers or drug addicts, guess who will be the 6th loser or drug addict? Hanging with the wrong crowd is dangerous and all it takes is being in the wrong place at the wrong time and your life can change forever. For example, if you are with someone that decides to commit a crime, and even if you don't participate, you will be an accomplice and there are cameras everywhere nowadays. It's not worth it to throw your life away over hanging with the wrong people in this world because at the end of the day Time is valuable and it is the only thing we cant get back in this world. You don't want to spend not even a day in jail or prison let alone a few years of your life. If the crime is a serious crime like murder for example you may never get out of jail again. And not only will you throw away your life but your family will suffer as well.</h4>

<h1>Real Friends<h1>

<h4>Making good friends is hard in this cold world. Don't be afraid to hang by yourself or walk alone in life. Dont be afraid to be a loner. Don't be afraid to eat at the table alone. The universe will send the right people your eay just be patient and let the universe to its job in life. Keep a positve mindset at all times. if you think positive the universe willbsend you positive vibrations. if you think or do negative things the universe will bring negativity towards you. keep god first and watch how good life will treat you </h4>

<h1>Lion Mentality<h1>

<h4>Have a lion mentality. For example,Lions are the king of the jungle. They walk alone. Eagles fly alone. Only sheep roll in packs. Dont follow the crowd, if everyone is going right, go left. </h4>

<h4>Social media apps can ruin your perception of what life is about. Don't believe everything you see on these apps. It's not real life. Notice how nobody posts their problems, and everybody seems to be ahead in life. Don't chase followers and likes as that stuff doesn't really matter in life. What matters in life is being happy, Family and having faith in God!
Scrolling all day and liking pictures and reading memes can cause damage to your brain and will not benefit you in the long run. It will actually do more damage to your brain if you just scroll all day and take selfies. Because it's a waste of time, and time is the only thing we don't get back in this world. It's good to be productive and read books. Even if it's a few pages a day, this will help the brain and make you smarter . They said the man who doesn't read lives ONE life. But the man who reads lives a thousand lives! Knowledge is power! It's good to log off and find your purpose in life! </h4>

<h4> This song was inspired by my own life experiences in 37 years of living on earth. My purpose for this blog is to inspire the youth and guide them in the right direction in life since theres a lack of Real Role Models in this world!
    This is a song by queens legend and artist Cormega. </h4>
